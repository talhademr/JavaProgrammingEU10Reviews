				Create a method that will give you the Fibonacci numbers up to the x value. Where x is the given parameter.
				Fibonacci is a sequence of number starting from 0, 1 where the following numbers are the sum of the previous 2 numbers
				Note: Fibonacci numbers are read as index values, so the 0th Fibonacci is 0, 1st value is 1, 2nd value is 1, etc
				    Ex:
				        Input:
				            8
				        Output:
				           1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
				            1- Create one method and only print the numbers
				            2- You will return the numbers
				            3- Yuo will put that numbers into the array then you will return it
